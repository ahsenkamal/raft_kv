Client:
    Send TCP packet with GET/SET/DEL instruction to a single endpoint acting as the Distributor/Gateway 

Distributor/Gateway:
    Discover running nodes (auto-discovery)
    Keep a list
    Receive TCP packets from clients 
    Send to leader node
    
Leader Node:
    Keep sending heartbeat
    On client request: Add log entry
    Replicate log (send log entry to nodes)
    Wait till majority respond (ack receiving)
    Commit the entry
    Notify about the commit

Follower Node:
    Start with a random timeout 250-500ms
    If nothing happens till timeout -> Become Candidate Node
    If received a heartbeat -> Do nothing
    If received a LogReplicationRequest -> Add entry and respond
    If received a VoteRequest{new_term} -> Vote if new_term>self.term + reset timeout

Candidate Node:
    Start another timeout
    Set votes=1
    Starts new term
    Send VoteRequest{term}
    Wait for majority votes
    If no majority -> retry after timeout
